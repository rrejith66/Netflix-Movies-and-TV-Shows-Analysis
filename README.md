# ðŸ“º Netflix Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

This project focuses on cleaning, preprocessing, and performing preliminary exploratory analysis on a dataset containing metadata about Netflix content. The goal is to prepare the dataset for insightful visualizations, storytelling, and future modeling work.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of metadata about Netflix's content such as:

- **Title, Type** (Movie/TV Show)
- **Director, Cast, Country**
- **Date Added to Netflix**
- **Release Year**

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Key cleaning steps performed:

- âœ… **Handled Missing Values**:
  - Filled `director`, `cast`, and `country` with `'Unknown'` or `'Not Available'`
  - Parsed and filled `date_added` with proper datetime format

- âœ… **Datetime Conversion**:
  - Converted `date_added` to `datetime64[ns]`
  - Extracted `year_added`, `month_added`, `day_of_week_added` from `date_added`

- âœ… **Standardized Text Columns**:
  - Removed leading/trailing spaces
  - Converted case using `.str.lower()` or `.str.title()`

- âœ… **Feature Engineering**:
  - Split `duration` into `duration_minutes`
  - Identified and isolated content trends by type, genre, and geography

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

- **Movies** dominate the Netflix catalog compared to TV Shows
- Most content was added between **2018â€“2020**

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements

- Perform in-depth EDA & visualization
- Build an interactive dashboard (Power BI, Tableau, or Plotly)
- Use this cleaned dataset for predictive modeling (e.g., content success prediction)
- Integrate genre clustering or recommendation systems
